# Slack Nav Scroll

## 1.0

It uses simple activity tracking to notice when the slack window is idle, first scrolling the purple nav to the bottom,
and randomly scrolls the purple nav column every 30 seconds or so when the window is inactive.  This is for people like
me who don't have slack in the foreground unless they need something and also have notifications off, but pass by email
and slack tabs once in a while to see if anything needs responding to.  I often miss that there are notifications below
the visible area in the purple nav, sometimes for weeks.  This just ensures that you'll eventually see the stuff lower
down the column.

Perhaps slack has better UI for this that I don't know about or maybe it's only for people with 4k monitors.
This helps me.
